# Overview
title: Ten-Grain Porridge Bread
excerpt: 'I found some old cooked cereal in my fridge, and so I developed this formula to use it up, along with a couple spare bags of flour I found at the back of the pantry. Not bad for a “kitchen sink” recipe. A large amount of cooked porridge (35%) gives this bread a tender, creamy crumb. Durum flour also adds a touch of sweetness.'

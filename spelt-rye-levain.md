# Overview
title: Spelt-Rye Levain
excerpt: 'There’s something special about pairing spelt and rye in a bread formula, especially at a 2:1 ratio. Their flavors complement each other extremely well, while spelt adds a lot of elasticity to the dough, which is fun to work with. This formula uses large amounts of both (25% spelt and 12.5% rye), with a pairing of high- and low-protein high-extraction wheat flours for the remainder. It was originally based on Trevor J. Wilson’s <a href="http://www.breadwerx.com/make-tartine-style-country-bread-video/" title="Tartine Style Country Bread" target="_blank">Tartine Style Country Bread</a>.'

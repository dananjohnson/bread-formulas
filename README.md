# Bread Formulas

A repository tracking development of my bread formulas. Recipe experimentation and evolution are tracked in branches. Recipes that appear in the master branch are considered “master” recipes. Not that they won’t undergo further development, but they will reliably make good bread.

This is a submodule of [A Breadbaker’s Notebook](https://github.com/dananjohnson/breadbakers-notebook), a simple, Jekyll-based website for viewing the master recipes.

# Overview
title: Brown Rice & Sesame Bread
excerpt: 'This formula was inspired by the simple but delicious Japanese dish of short-grain brown rice (<em>genmai</em>) served with toasted sesame seeds and salt (<em>goma-shio</em>). Here, those flavors are incorporated into a hearth loaf with lots of pre-fermented whole wheat flour for an even greater depth of flavor. The formula was originally based on “Brown Rice Bread” from Hamelman’s <em>Bread</em>.'

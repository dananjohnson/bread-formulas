# Overview
title: Vermont Whole-Grain Sourdough with Durum Wheat
excerpt: 'A light, tangy sourdough based on the “Vermont Sourdough” recipe from Jeffrey Hamelman’s <i>Bread</i>, with the addition of flavorful, identity-preserved Edison, durum wheat (semolina), and Skagit 1109 wheats, as well as 10% higher hydration. Consider trying other wheat varieties as well, with the consideration that lower-protein (10–11%) flours will balance out the higher protein bread flour.'

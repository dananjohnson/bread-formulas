# Overview
title: Hundo/Hundo Whole Wheat Sourdough
excerpt: "A bread formula for the romantic type: 100% whole-grain Yecora Rojo. 100% water. Salt. Nothing more. This formula uses a stiff levain to build strength before the addition of so much water. We also sift a portion of the bran—reincorporating it later as a soaker—to prevent tearing in the dough."

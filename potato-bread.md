# Overview
title: Roasted Potato Bread
excerpt: 'Potatoes add an incomparable softness and flavor to sourdough breads. This recipe is an adaptation of a formula of the same name in Hamelman’s <i>Bread</i>, converted from yeasted to sourdough development. Roasting the potatoes concentrates their flavor, while the increased hydration and overnight proof create a tangy, tender crumb.'
